# BMYAlbums

The BASIS Meet Yourself, inspired by Tucson Meet Yourself, is one of the most popular events of the school year. We get to celebrate the cultural diversity of the school through cultural clothing, snacks, activities, and performances!

Experience BMY through the years with our vinyl and K-pop inspired music album!
